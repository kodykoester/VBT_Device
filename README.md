## What is this?

<p> Velocity-based training (VBT) device is a piece of equipment designed to measure the velocity of movement during resistance training exercises. In other words, we are measuring 'intensity' of an exercise by how fast the athlete moves the barbell or weight.<p>

## Why do I need one?

Strength coaches control as much as they can (rest, sets, reps, weight, etc) to make the biggest impact for their athletes. What happens when external factors like sleep, stress, nutrition get in the way? Meet velocity based training. 

There are plenty of reason VBT is benifical: 

**Individualized Prescription:** VBT allows for a more individualized and dynamic approach to resistance training. Instead of prescribing fixed loads based on percentages of one's one-repetition maximum (1RM), VBT considers an individual's current capabilities and fatigue levels, adjusting loads in real-time.

**Auto-Regulation:** By monitoring velocity, athletes can adjust their training intensity based on their daily readiness and fatigue levels. This concept is known as auto-regulation. If an athlete is not moving a weight at the desired velocity, it may indicate fatigue, and they can adjust the load accordingly to maintain optimal training intensity.

**Objective Feedback:** VBT provides objective feedback on the speed of each repetition. This can help athletes and coaches identify patterns, weaknesses, or areas for improvement in their lifting technique. It offers a more quantitative approach to performance assessment.

**Power Development:** Power is a critical component in many sports. VBT allows athletes to monitor and target specific power output levels during resistance training, helping to enhance explosive strength and speed.

**Avoidance of Overtraining:** Traditional training programs may not account for daily variations in an individual's readiness or recovery status. VBT enables athletes to avoid overtraining by adjusting their training loads based on real-time data.

**Motivation and Engagement:** The immediate feedback provided by VBT devices can be motivating for individuals during training sessions. Seeing improvements in velocity or power output can enhance engagement and adherence to a training program.

**Research and Monitoring:** VBT devices also have applications in research and monitoring. Researchers can use these tools to study movement patterns, fatigue, and performance across different populations and training protocols.
