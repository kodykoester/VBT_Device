## What? 
<p>a piece of equipment designed to measure the velocity a weight travels during an exercises. In other words, a way to measure 'intensity' of an exercise in meters per second.<p>

## Why?

Strength coaches control as many factors as possible to help train their athletes appropriately and specifically. Think rest, sets, reps, weight, etc. <!-- are all ways coaches manipulate a training program to make the biggest impact for their athletes. -->
<br> <br>
What happens when external factors like sleep, stress, nutrition get in the way? These devices account for such factors with something called:
<br>
**Auto-Regulation:** By monitoring velocity of a given exercise, athletes can adjust their training weight based on their daily readiness and fatigue levels. This concept is known as auto-regulation. If an athlete is not moving a weight at the desired velocity, it may indicate fatigue, and they can adjust the load accordingly to maintain optimal training intensity.

There are plenty of additional reasons VBT is benifical: 

**Individualized Prescription:** VBT allows for a more individualized and dynamic approach to resistance training. Instead of prescribing fixed loads based on percentages of one's one-repetition maximum (1RM), VBT considers an individual's current capabilities and fatigue levels, adjusting loads in real-time.

**Objective Feedback:** VBT provides objective feedback on the speed of each repetition. This can help athletes and coaches identify patterns, weaknesses, or areas for improvement in their lifting technique. It offers a more quantitative approach to performance assessment.

**Power Development:** Power is a critical component in many sports. VBT allows athletes to monitor and target specific power output levels during resistance training, helping to enhance explosive strength and speed.

**Avoidance of Overtraining:** Traditional training programs may not account for daily variations in an individual's readiness or recovery status. VBT enables athletes to avoid overtraining by adjusting their training loads based on real-time data.

**Motivation and Engagement:** The immediate feedback provided by VBT devices can be motivating for individuals during training sessions. Seeing improvements in velocity or power output can enhance engagement and adherence to a training program.

**Research and Monitoring:** VBT devices also have applications in research and monitoring. Researchers can use these tools to study movement patterns, fatigue, and performance across different populations and training protocols.
