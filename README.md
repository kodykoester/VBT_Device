<h2 align="center">Velocity Based Training Device</h2>

---

<p align="center"> This Arduino-based project utilizes the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense and its built-in accelerometer to create a velocity-based training (VBT) device. The device is designed to manage athletic output by dynamically adjusting training loads based on the athlete's daily condition.
    <br>
  The concept of VBT recognizes that an athlete's performance can vary daily due to factors such as sleep, stress, and nutrition. By adapting training intensity to the athlete's daily capabilities, the device aims to optimize performance and reduce the risk of overtraining.

## What <a name = "what"></a>
A device that measure the "intensity" of an exercise. 

## Why <a name = "why"><a/>
In sports performance, knowing an athlete's one rep max is key to progression. A great coach is already leveraging factors such as reps, sets, tempo, and rest. how can we be sure we're training the correct intensity when we can't control what happens outside the gym? Did the athlete get enough sleep? How was their nutrition since their last workout? Are they stressed about work or school? All these factors can effect an athletes "daily one rep max."

No matter the external factors, velocity based training devices can help prescribe the correct "intensities" based on how an athlete is feeling for the day.

## The Problem <a name = "problem"></a>
When I was an Intern at the University of Minnesota - Duluth (Go Dawgs) we used a $1,200 "Tendo machine." That's not practical. 


## Limitations <a name = "limitations"></a>
Coming soon.

## ðŸš€ Future Scope <a name = "future_scope"></a>
Build a nice UI for BLE and web based applications.
