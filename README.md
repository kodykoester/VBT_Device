---


  The concept of VBT recognizes that an athlete's performance can vary each training session due to factors such as sleep, nutrition, stress, etc. By adapting to the athlete's daily capabilities, the device aims to optimize performance and reduce the risk of overtraining.



## What <a name = "what"></a>
A device that measures the "intensity" of an exercise. 

## Why <a name = "why"><a/>
In sports performance, knowing an athlete's one rep max is key to progression. A great coach is already leveraging factors such as reps, sets, tempo, and rest. but how can we be sure we're training the correct intensity when we can't control what happens outside the gym? Did the athlete get enough sleep? How was their nutrition since their last workout? Are they stressed about work or school? All these factors can affect an athlete's "daily one rep max."

No matter the external factors, velocity-based training devices can help prescribe the correct "intensities" based on how an athlete is feeling for the day.

## The Problem <a name = "problem"></a>
When I was an Intern at the University of Minnesota - Duluth (Go Dawgs!) we used a $1,200 "Tendo machine." That's not practical. 

## Limitations <a name = "limitations"></a>
Coming soon.

## ðŸš€ Future Scope <a name = "future_scope"></a>

Build a nice UI for BLE and web-based applications.
