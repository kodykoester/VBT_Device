    Strength coaches control as many factors as possible to help train their athletes appropriately and specifically. Think rest, sets, reps, weight, etc. 
    <br>
    What happens when external factors like sleep, stress, nutrition get in the way? These devices account for such factors with something called:
    <br>
    <strong>Auto-Regulation:</strong> By monitoring velocity of a given exercise, athletes can adjust their training weight based on their daily readiness and fatigue levels. This concept is known as auto-regulation. If an athlete is not moving a weight at the desired velocity, it may indicate fatigue, and they can adjust the load accordingly to maintain optimal training intensity.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

There are many great README templates available on GitHub; however, I didn't find one that really suited my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a README template so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need -- I think this is it.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!

Use the `BLANK_README.md` to get started.
